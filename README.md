# WALLABY Kinematic Analysis Proto Pipeline
 This repo contains a set of python scripts that, together comprise the WALLABY Kinematic Analysis Proto Pipeline (WKAPP), which isused to generate the initial kinematic models for the WALLABY Pilot Phase I Observations. This proto-pipeline uses a variety of different software, along with specific user interventions, to generate the models for the pilot phase I observations.
 
 A full how-to guide on using these scripts is found in DOCUMENTATION/WALLABY_Kinematic_Analysis_Proto_Pipeline_User_Guide.pdf
